## 3D Simulate
This is a project i started as a way to tie in my visualization background into the field of simulation i found myself in back in 2005. Using the SBW framework this tool would allow to simulate arbitrary SBML files (though preferably those created by JDesigner), by rendering a graphical representation of the network and then rendering the species concentrations on top of it.
